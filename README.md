## NLP Prediction of Weather Events
Utilizing data sourced from Twitter tweets that were gathered during natural weather events, this project utilizes the text features of each entry to build a model that can classify what kind of event the tweet is related to (Earthquake, Fire, etc.). In order to do this, Google's BERT model is utilized to gather vector representations of each entries text information and then these representations are modeled by different classifiers!
